    <h1>Goodbye, PokeDS~</h1>

    <p>
      In 2005, I started a Pokemon guild on Neopets called The Pokemon Land Guild.
      I'd go on to make a website for this guild, which would mark the start of my
      Pokemon fansite journey. In 2007, I decided that PLG had outgrown its
      origins as a Neopets guild website, and thus I renamed the site to
      "Shadow of the Desert". And in 2010, I decided to make the name of the site
      snappier and renamed "Shadow of the Desert" to "Pokemon Desert Shadow" or
      "PokeDS" for short.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time between 2010 and 2012, PokeDS had gone through a lot of changes.
      I remember I wanted to add a Pokemon tracker to the site though that project
      had never quite materialized. I think I rewrote PokeDS from scratch 3 times.
      I remember when PokeDS was most active, we'd often hang out in the chatrooms
      with several users online at a time. I remember we'd get into poking wars.
      And we'd start up silly little threads and come up with cutesy ideas for
      features to add to the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it's 2017, and it's been 12 years since I first started that little site
      called the Pokemon Land Guild. My life today looks a lot different than it
      did in those years. Back then, I was mostly just a kid who had a strange
      obsession with Pokemon, and a peculiar interast in web development. Now I've
      grown up into an adult with a job and maintaining PokeDS just
      doesn't quite make as much sense in my life as it used to.
    </p>
    <p>
      To everyone visiting this page: I know some of you have been with the site
      since those very early days when we called ourselves "PLG". And I know
      many others of you found the site in its later days. There are many of you
      I remember well,and I remember the friends I had made through the site.
      I have to say... To everyone who's ever visited PokeDS, thanks. I have a lot
      of fond memories of interacting with visitors on PokeDS, and the site
      wouldn't have been what it was without you. I hope you all have wonderful
      days~
